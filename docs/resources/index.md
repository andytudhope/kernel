# Create and Connect with Better Tools

When we began this course, this was just a single page with a few of the best tools we knew and used in our own practice. Of course, when you gather the best and brightest minds together, a whole lot of interesting stuff falls out the cracks, so we've had to expand it into it's own section on the website.

The idea remains the same: you will only find the most useful, paradigm-shifting tools and resources here that we know of. This is not meant as a comprehensive and never-ending list of every tool available: it is a highly curated collection of things that have genuinely changed our day-to-day lives as developers, designers, product managers, and dreamers.

A bespoke Notion page that will help you get to know your cohort 
and navigate all the different facets of the next 8 weeks. Find people to team up with, learn more about the structure and get access to yet more tools.

Our communal fireplace. This is a space for reflective and meditative 
conversations and connections - not instant gratification. Here we 
build better conversations which will evolve into Web 3.
