# Reads

Tools aren't only about practical ways of doing things - they can also be guides on how to think about a project; how to frame certain issues; how to optimise processes; how other people have solved their own problems and what they learnt as a result of their efforts. Here we present the resources our community has consistently turned to in their endeavour to understand what it really means to build a better web and how we can share that meaning with those who matter most to us.
