# Crafted Reading - Jamming On Value

## üåå Of Mirrorworlds and Metaverses

## <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call It Mirrorworld</a>

The vision of a unified virtual world has been in our imaginations for decades. In this article Kevin Kelly calls it **Mirrorworld**, as popularized by David Gelernter in the 90s.

Call it Mirrorworld or Metaverse, but it has always been a long time coming, with articles similar to this appearing every few years.

 This second article is written by David Baszucki: the CEO of Roblox, one of the gaming platforms aiming to become the Metaverse.

This is a helpful primer on the current technologies and standards that might help shape the future Metaverse. It discusses wide-ranging technologies including AR, VR, AI and crypto.

Or perhaps the Metaverse is already here, and it's just not evenly distributed? Tony Sheng once again gives us a helpful, complementary opposite view.

## Breakout Activity

For this weekend, we're inviting the Kernel Gaming Track fellows to participate in Global Game Jam 2021: the largest game creation event taking place around the globe. 

Please register at the link below:

<a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2021/jam-sites/kernel-gaming-guild-game-jam-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernel Gaming Track Global Game Jam Registration</a>

Fellows will create a game over the weekend based on an announced theme. The theme will be announced at the start of the jam (Friday) and will be shared on Slack.

Games don't _have_ to be video games; they can be anything from a board game or a card game, as long as it adheres to the theme. It might also be a good exercise to design a game that explores Web 3 concepts.
