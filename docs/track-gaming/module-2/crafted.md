## Breakout Activity

For this week, we'll be using Tableau and Google Sheets to create a similar timeline of relevant articles for our Web 3 projects.

[Link to the Tableau project.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/paul.gadi#!/vizhome/GameIndustryTimeline/GameIndustryTimelinebasedonselectGamasutraArticles)

[Link to the Google Sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NwNkNDqk31cKXO5e5vm3xWs4ieUU-sgot_7hu6f4pmg/edit#gid=0)

Make a copy of each one, and then go to a relevant industry news source. Do a search for topics / technologies related to your project (for NFT projects for example, some valid searches are "virtual items", "art", "generative graphics"), and then curate at least one article for each of the last 10 years.

Once done, please share your Tableau project on Slack. It will be useful learning also for your peers! üôå
