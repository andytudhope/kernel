# The Kernel Gaming Track

![Gaming Track](./img/gaming_track.jpg)


The **Kernel Gaming Track** has the same [Core Learning Objectives](../../getting-started) as the **Kernel Learn Track**, with a greater focus on those building games and other incentivized systems in Web 3. 

After each module in the **Learn Track**, we will share a few more articles that will hopefully deepen your appreciation of the learnings, this time in a gaming context. We'll supplement these with Firesides with invited guest speakers, plus juntos among our peer mentors.

## Structure

1. The **Core Learning** will contain a brief summary of one of the topics in the Learn Track for the given week. It's intended to be a quick recap for those who didn't have the time to go through the whole module.

2. The **Crafted Reading** is a set of articles to broaden our knowledge of the **Core Learning**. We hope you'll read them before each Fireside as they'll be the points of discussion.

3. The **Curated Material** will be a collection of other links that should be helpful for those who want to dive deeper. They will cover a wider range of topics related not just to the Core Learning but to the week's whole Learn Track module.

## Timing

1. Firesides are held weekly on **Wednedays 10 AM EST**. [Click Here to add it to your calendar 📅](https://www.addevent.com/calendar/RU314582)

2. The general structure of Firesides will be a 20-minute on-stage discussion of the **Core Learning** and **Crafted Reading** material, followed by a breakout activity.

3. Throughout the course of each week, we will also have a number of smaller conversations on a variety of themes. These conversations are hosted between you and other members of your cohort, because we learn best from our own peers.

## 🙏 A Word of Thanks, A Game Each Week 🎮

We look forward to having [meaningful conversations](../../module-0#cultured-conversation) and playing games together each week. Thank you for being part of this journey! 

Here's a relevant quote (and a game!) from one of my favorite game designers:
