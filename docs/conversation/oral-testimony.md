# Oral Testimony

This page provides a small experience of a recitation of the Great Law of Peace, in order to frame our return to indigenous, sustainable protocols for peace, based on a more accurate understanding of our shared, human history. If you still have it, you can find more recordings on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/reconstitutioneagleandcondor/videos/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katsitenserio's Facebook page</a>.

## Relevant History and Anthropology

Akala's address at the Oxford Union and David Gareber and David Wengrow's discussion at the University of Amsterdam both provide important intellectual background for those less able to follow what is being transmitted in the oral testimony above.
