## How does this fit in?

The above brainpickings article, which summarizes a letter sent by Vincent Van Gogh to his brother in 1879, has been selected to help you deepen your own approach to:

1. Asking better questions
2. Thinking deeply about your intention
3. How you define both 'value' and 'trust'
4. Think about what you, personally, are doing here? What is your question?

## Full Brief

> "Improvement in my life â€” should I not desire it or should I not be in need of improvement? I really want to improve. But itâ€™s precisely because I yearn for it that Iâ€™m afraid of remedies that are worse than the disease." 

How do we handle this tension between improving and being joyfully who we already are?

> "Such idling is really a rather strange sort of idling. Itâ€™s rather difficult for me to defend myself on this score, but I would be sorry if you couldnâ€™t eventually see this in a different light."

Van Gogh presents tinkering as a better way of being. In our own time, it may not be about building more products for 'consumers', but rather using new [trust spaces](../trust) to commune in a different and digital sense.

> "Such a person doesnâ€™t always know himself what he could do, but he feels by instinct, Iâ€™m good for something, even so! I feel I have a *raison dâ€™Ãªtre*! I know that I could be a quite different man! For what then could I be of use, for what could I serve! Thereâ€™s something within me, **so what is it!"**

What is in your heart of hearts? You may wonder how relevant this question is, but we cannot build a better web if we do not first understand what it might mean to be better ourselves. And that requires deep enquiry into the nature of self: there is no other way.

> "But whatâ€™s your ultimate goal, youâ€™ll say. The goal will become clearer, will take shape slowly and surely, as the croquis becomes a sketch and the sketch a painting, as one works more seriously, as one digs deeper into the originally vague idea, the first fugitive, passing thought."

Do you trust the inner voice? Again, a seemingly abstract question with profound implications for what we actually, in practice, understand trust to be; which is then directly reflected in the kinds of products we build.

> "Iâ€™m always inclined to believe that the best way of knowing is to love a great deal. Love that friend, that person, that thing, whatever you like, youâ€™ll be on the right path to knowing more thoroughly, afterwards; thatâ€™s what I say to myself. But you must love with a high, serious intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence, and you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better, and more."
